# FUN  HOROSCOPE  GAME
This is my small Java Game which I came up with during my BTech 1st Year as a Assignment/Project.
Basically the main goal was to create a Project using few OOP's Concepts of Java.The Concept is about creating a game based on the structure of horoscope.

The basic purpose of this program is to provide some basic personal details of the user (i.e. name,age,gender,etc) as an input to the code which then interprets it and the system generates a funny horoscope which includes:\
Birth Star, Cartoon Character, Ancient Ancestor, Celebrity Crush, Special Ability, Secret Hidden In his Name.

### Topics Included 
Polymorphism, Constructors, Methods, Scanner-function, While Loop, If-else Statements, SwitchCases, Conditional Operators, Objects & Classes.
