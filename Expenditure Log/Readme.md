# EXPENDITURE LOG
A GUI Application Program which helps in tracking our expenditure.
We can add, update, display and delete the records of expenditure using MySQL commands ( like DDL, DML, DQL Commands ) and finally store the data in database using MySQL.

This is just a sample/prototype, we can make it more efficient and more user friendly.

Here are the Snippets of the Application...
